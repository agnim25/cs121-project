This probability is used in the analysis of symmetric-key primitives that combine XOR and modular addition, such as the increasingly popular Addition-Rotation-XOR (ARX) constructions. The focus of this paper is on maximal differentials, which are helpful when constructing differential trails. We provide the missing proof for Theorem 3 of the FSE 2004 paper, which states that max α, β adp⊕(α, β→ γ)= adp⊕(0, γ→ γ) for all γ. Furthermore, we prove that there always exist either two or eight distinct pairs α, β such that adp⊕(α, β→ γ)= adp⊕(0, γ→ γ), and we obtain recurrence formulas for calculating adp⊕. To gain insight into the range of possible differential probabilities, we also study other properties such as the minimum value of adp⊕(0, γ→ γ), and we find all γ that satisfy this minimum value.",2021-06-11

A key focus of the modeling approach is to minimize the number of dynamic states required to adequately describe the system dynamics. The resulting model is well-suited for model-based control design, real-time simulation, and hardware-in-the-loop testing aimed at intelligent operation of TES systems. We use a discretized approach to model the temperature dynamics of the water within the storage tank. We use a quasi-steady approach to model the IHX coil dynamics, thereby limiting computational complexity. In simulation, the model runs up to 1200× faster than real-time. A simulated case study of model-based feedback control demonstrates the utility of the modeling approach.

Yet, precisely how the topological structure of knowledge constrains its acquisition remains unknown, hampering the development of learning enhancement strategies. Here, we study the topological structure of semantic networks reflecting mathematical concepts and their relations in college-level linear algebra texts. We hypothesize that these networks will exhibit structural order, reflecting the logical sequence of topics that ensures accessibility. We find that the networks exhibit strong core–periphery architecture, where a dense core of concepts presented early is complemented with a sparse periphery presented evenly throughout the exposition; the latter is composed of many small modules each reflecting more narrow domains.

However, such models are shown vulnerable against adversarial attacks which aim to apply stealthy semantic transformations such as rotation and tapering to mislead model predictions. In this paper, we propose a transformation-specific smoothing framework TPC, which provides tight and scalable robustness guarantees for point cloud models against semantic transformation attacks. We first categorize common 3D transformations into two categories: composable (eg, rotation) and indirectly composable (eg, tapering), and we present generic robustness certification strategies for both categories. We then specify unique certification protocols for a range of specific semantic transformations and derive strong robustness guarantees. Extensive experiments on several common 3D transformations show that TPC significantly outperforms the state of the art. For example, our framework boosts the certified accuracy against twisting transformation along z-axis (within 20 {\textdegree}) from 20.3% to 83.8%.

The models used in protein crystallography for the last 50 years provide good fits to experimental I(q) versus nominal dose data, but have unclear physical significance. More recently, a fit to diffraction and imaging experiments suggested that the maximum tolerable dose varies as q−1 or linearly with resolution. Here, it is shown that crystallographic data have been strongly perturbed by the effects of spatially nonuniform crystal irradiation and diffraction during data collection. Reanalysis shows that these data are consistent with a purely exponential local dose dependence, \tilde I(q,D) = I0(q)exp[−D/De(q)], where De(q) ∝ qα with α ≃ 1.7.

In particular, a scenario tree is constructed from a finite set of policies of the uncontrolled agent, and the branch MPC solves for a feedback policy in the form of a trajectory tree, which shares the same topology as the scenario tree.

Among them, Fourier neural operator (FNO) has shown success in learning solution operators for highly non-linear problems such as turbulence flow. FNO is discretization-invariant, where it can be trained on low-resolution data and generalizes to problems with high-resolution. This property is related to the low-pass filters in FNO, where only a limited number of frequency modes are selected to propagate information. However, it is still a challenge to select an appropriate number of frequency modes and training resolution for different PDEs. Too few frequency modes and low-resolution data hurt generalization, while too many frequency modes and high-resolution data are computationally expensive and lead to over-fitting. To this end, we propose Incremental Fourier Neural Operator (IFNO), which augments both the frequency modes and data resolution incrementally during training. We show that IFNO achieves better generalization (around 15% reduction on testing L2 loss) while reducing the computational cost by 35%, compared to the standard FNO. In addition, we observe that IFNO follows the behavior of implicit regularization in FNO, which explains its excellent generalization ability.",2022-11-01

With several industries looking to capitalize on robotics technology, the need for robust, safe, and efficient robotic platforms becomes larger and larger. The promise of legged robots comes with an expectation to navigate rugged terrains. Furthermore, safely managing these environments and executing autonomous missions heavily tax platforms. The importance of versatile, robust, and highly dynamic legged robots have, as a consequence, never been more relevant. This thesis focuses on the design and control of a torque controllable quadrupedal robot. In contrast to recent well-renowned quadrupeds, where leg configurations typically are mammal-like, the quadrupedal robot ASTRo is built with a sprawling-like configuration. Inspired by elements found in nature, a sprawling posture offer advantages for navigating rugged terrain and overcoming significant obstacles relative to its body size. In each of ASTRo's twelve joints, proprioceptive electric actuators provide precise torque control such that highly dynamic locomotion can be achieved. The development of highly dynamic legged robots requires dealing with both the inherent hybrid nature of legged systems and the high-dimensional, nonlinear, and underactuated system dynamics. To this end, we investigate and present a concept for whole-body control based on hierarchical optimization with inverse dynamics control. By decomposing the complex behavior of the system into a set of tasks, the hierarchical optimization controller can facilitate the desired behavior by solving the set of tasks in a strictly …",2021-11-09
14,19,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/21/8541,"Spacecraft relative pose estimation for an uncooperative spacecraft is challenging because the target spacecraft neither provides sensor information to a chaser spacecraft nor contains markers that assist vision-based navigation. Moreover, the chaser does not have prior pose estimates when initiating the pose estimation. This paper proposes a new monocular pose estimation algorithm that addresses these issues in pose initialization situations for a known but uncooperative target spacecraft. The proposed algorithm finds convexity defect features from a target image and uses them as cues for matching feature points on the image to the points on the known target model. Based on this novel method for model matching, it estimates a pose by solving the PnP problem. Pose estimation simulations are carried out in three test scenarios, and each assesses the estimation accuracy and initialization performance by varying relative attitudes and distances. The simulation results show that the algorithm can estimate the poses of spacecraft models when a solar panel length and the number of solar panels are changed. Furthermore, a scenario considering the surface property of the spacecraft emphasizes that robust feature detection is essential for accurate pose estimation. This algorithm can be used for proximity operations with a known but uncooperative target spacecraft. Specifically, one of the main applications is relative navigation for on-orbit servicing.",2022-11-06

We circumvent this challenge by using additional data from proxy distributions learned by advanced generative models. We first seek to formally understand the transfer of robustness from classifiers trained on proxy distributions to the real data distribution. We prove that the difference between the robustness of a classifier on the two distributions is upper bounded by the conditional Wasserstein distance between them. Next we use proxy distributions to significantly improve the performance of adversarial training on five different datasets. For example, we improve robust accuracy by up to 7.5% and 6.7% in  and  threat model over baselines that are not using proxy distributions on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We also improve certified robust accuracy by 7.6% on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We further demonstrate that different generative models bring a disparate improvement in the performance in robust training. We propose a robust discrimination approach to characterize the impact of individual generative models and further provide a deeper understanding of why current state-of-the-art in diffusion-based generative models are a better choice for proxy distribution than generative adversarial networks.",2021-04-19

On the other hand, general linear maps, such as positive but not completely positive maps, which can not be physically implemented, are fundamental ingredients in quantum information, both in theoretical and practical perspectives. This raises the question of how well one can simulate or approximate the action of a general linear map by physically implementable operations. In this work, we introduce a systematic framework to resolve this task using the quasiprobability decomposition technique. We decompose a target linear map into a linear combination of physically implementable operations and introduce the $\textit {physical implementability} $ measure as the least amount of negative portion that the quasiprobability must pertain, which directly quantifies the cost of simulating a given map using physically implementable quantum operations. We show this measure is efficiently computable by semidefinite programs and prove several properties of this measure, such as faithfulness, additivity, and unitary invariance. We derive lower and upper bounds in terms of the Choi operator's trace norm and obtain analytic expressions for several linear maps of practical interests. Furthermore, we endow this measure with an operational meaning within the quantum error mitigation scenario: it establishes the lower bound of the sampling cost achievable via the quasiprobability decomposition technique. In particular, for parallel quantum noises, we show that global error mitigation has no advantage over local error mitigation.",2021-12-07

Many algorithms for SPR start from an initial reference molecule, and alternate between refining the estimated viewing angles given the molecule, and refining the molecule given the viewing angles. This scheme is called iterative refinement. Reliance on an initial, user-chosen reference introduces model bias, and poor initialization can lead to slow convergence. Furthermore, since no ground truth is available for an unsolved molecule, it is difficult to validate the obtained results. This creates the need for high quality ab initio models that can be quickly obtained from experimental data with minimal priors, and which can also be used for validation.

Recently, this has been generalized to neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces. For partial differential equations (PDEs), neural operators directly learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution. Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation.

This algorithm uses  less communication per iteration than full-precision, distributed SGD. Under natural conditions verified by experiment, we prove that signSGD converges in the large and mini-batch settings, establishing convergence for a parameter regime of Adam as a byproduct. Aggregating sign gradients by majority vote means that no individual worker has too much power. We prove that unlike SGD, majority vote is robust when up to 50% of workers behave adversarially.

DR-RO control considers the regret in LQR cost between a causal and non-causal controller and aims to minimize the worst-case regret over all disturbances whose probability distribution is within a certain Wasserstein-2 ball of a nominal distribution. Our work builds upon the full-information DR-RO problem that was introduced and solved in Yan et al., 2023 [1], and extends it to handle partial observability and measurement-feedback (MF). We solve the finite horizon partially observable DR-RO and show that it reduces to a tractable semi-definite program whose size is proportional to the time horizon. Through simulations, the effectiveness and performance of the framework are demonstrated, showcasing its practical relevance to real-world control systems. The …",2023-09-26

Here we combine first-principles e-ph calculations with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) as a step toward a unified description of e− e and e-ph interactions in correlated materials. We compute the e-ph self-energy using the DMFT electron Green's function and combine it with the e− e self-energy from DMFT to obtain a Green's function including both interactions. This approach captures the renormalization of quasiparticle dispersion and spectral weight on equal footing. Using our method, we study the e-ph and e− e contributions to the resistivity and spectral functions in the correlated metal Sr 2 RuO 4.

In the experiment a small amount of water vapor is introduced into a weakly-ionized plasma where the background gas is at cryogenic temperatures. The experiment uses liquid helium cryocoolers instead of previously used liquid nitrogen to enable operation at much colder temperatures than previously accessible. Furthermore, there is tight control and adjustability of both the temperature and the temperature gradient. The first two years of the project were devoted to construction and debugging and the remaining time was devoted to scientific investigations. There was a parallel effort in which theoretical models were developed describing the nucleation ice nucleation and growth processes. The ice grains range from being just a few atoms when first formed, to as large as 2 mm. The ice grains are nearly perfectly confined in the plasma because they have a negative charge while the plasma has a positive potential. The experiment has been diagnosed using photography with a long-distance microscope lens, laser illumination of the dust grains, laser induced fluorescence, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR). The FTIR measurements show that at temperatures below 80 K the ice grains are in an amorphous phase, above 150 K they are in a crystalline phase, and between 80 K and 150 K they are in a mixture of these two phases.

We demonstrate that strong entrainment is possible for small values of squeezing, and in this regime, the states are nonclassical.
